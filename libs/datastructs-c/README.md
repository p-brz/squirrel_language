Arraylist and Hashtable in C
============================

(c) 2011 @marekweb

Objective
---------

Lists and mappings are two of the most common generic data types. This library implements both, independantly, in pure C. It aims to be simple and concise, while being completely generic.

It uses void pointers (`void*`) as its value type in order to remain generic. In other words, you can use it to store any kind of reference values, including strings.

The code follows the C99 standard. If you're compiling using `gcc`, use the `-std=c99` flag.

Use in your project
-------------------

You can use arraylist.c and hashtable.c by placing them in your project.

This library uses headers generated by `makeheaders`. The `#if INTERFACE` lines are artifacts of this. You don't have to worry about this if you're not making changes to the files.


Arraylists
-----------

The `arraylist.c` file contains an arraylist implementation. It is implemented as a dynamic array which is automatically resized as needed.

Usage:

```c
arraylist* mylist = arraylist_create();
arraylist_add(mylist, value);
void* result = arraylist_pop(mylist);
```

Hashtables
-----------

The `hashtable.c` file contains a hashtable implementation. It is implemented with open addressing and linear probing. It is automatically resized as needed.

Usage:

```c
hashtable* mytable = hashtable_create();
hashtable_set(mytable, "foo", value1);
hashtable_remove(mytable, "boo");
void* result = hashtable_get(mytable, "bar");
```
